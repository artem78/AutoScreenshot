# ToDo: Reserved for compatibility with old (Delphi 7) code. Remove this in the future.

# Uncomment these types if you want even more clean repository. But be careful.
# It can make harm to an existing project source. Read explanations below.
#
# Resource files are binaries containing manifest, project icon and version info.
# They can not be viewed as text or compared by diff-tools. Consider replacing them with .rc files.
*.res

# Since Delphi 2009 it is produced from .ridl file and can safely be ignored.
#*.tlb
#
# Diagram Portfolio file. Used by the diagram editor up to Delphi 7.
# Uncomment this if you are not using diagrams or use newer Delphi version.
